After completing a course of setting and running a number of MT experiments, described in this thesis, it is now possible to draw the following conclusions:

On the technical side:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Created a setup for running a very large number of experiments on a moderate GPU cluster;
    \item Proposed and re-assessed a stopping criterion for the experiments;
    \item Found and utilized a tool for visual inspection of a massive number of experiment results.
\end{itemize}

On the experimental side, carried out and interpreted the results for many English-to-X multilingual models:

\begin{outline}
\1 Setups were run on a domain-diverse training set for up to 36 target languages, and also sometimes complemented on a multi-parallel set for up to 5 target languages;
\1 Confirmed that generally, the more target languages in the model, the worse the performance.
\1 Observed the improved results for a Germanic set of languages
\1 Identified interesting exceptions:
  
  \2 Targeting the spoken domain, the quality does not decrease;
  \2 Targeting the same script (Cyrillic), the quality decreases less or does not decrease;
