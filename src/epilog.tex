On the technical side:

- Created a set up for running a very large number of experiments on a moderate GPU cluster
- Proposed and re-assessed a stopping criterion for the experiments.
- Found and utilized a tool for visual inspection of a massive number of experiment results (how many results in total?)
...maybe something else, too

On the experimental side, carried out and interpreted the results for many English-to-X multilingual models:

- Setups were run on a domain-diverse training set for up to 36 target languages, and also sometimes complemented on a multi-parallel set for up to 5 target languages.
- Confirmed that generally, the more target languages in the model, the worse the performance.
- Identified interesting exceptions:
  (you need to check the following)
  - Targetting the spoken domain, the quality does not decrease.
  - Targetting the same script (Cyrillic), the quality decreases less or does not decrease.
  - maybe something else
